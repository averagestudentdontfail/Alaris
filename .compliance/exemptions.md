# Coding Standard Exemptions

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-20

## Purpose

This document tracks approved exemptions from the Alaris High-Integrity Coding Standard. All exemptions must be:
1. Technically justified
2. Documented with rationale
3. Reviewed and approved
4. Re-evaluated periodically

---

## Active Exemptions

### EX-001: PriceOptionSync Method Length

**Rule**: Rule 13 (Small Functions - Max 60 lines)

**Location**: `Alaris.Strategy/Bridge/UnifiedPricingEngine.cs:567`

**Method**: `private double PriceOptionSync(OptionParameters parameters)`

**Current Length**: 66 lines

**Violation**: Exceeds 60-line limit by 6 lines

**Justification**:
- Method is critical for memory safety (Rule 16 compliance)
- ~21 lines (32%) are disposal calls for 14 QuantLib objects
- Disposal order is critical (reverse of creation) and must be explicit
- Breaking into helper methods would:
  - Obscure the disposal pattern
  - Increase risk of missing disposal calls
  - Reduce clarity for maintainers
  - Create false sense of complexity reduction
- **Actual logic**: ~45 lines (within threshold)
- **Boilerplate disposal**: ~21 lines (not complexity)

**Decision**: **APPROVED** - Accept as-is

**Rationale**: This method is the reference implementation for Rule 16 (Deterministic Cleanup), which is **more critical** than Rule 13. Memory safety takes precedence over line count.

**Alternative Considered**: Extract disposal into helper method
**Rejected Because**: Would hide critical cleanup logic and increase maintenance risk

**Review Date**: 2025-11-20
**Approved By**: Initial Assessment
**Next Review**: 2026-02-20 (3 months)

### EX-002: Alaris.Quantlib Project-Wide Exclusion

**Rule**: All Rules (Project-level exclusion from strict enforcement)

**Location**: `Alaris.Quantlib/*.cs` (entire project)

**Component**: Alaris.Quantlib - SWIG-generated C++/CLI wrapper for QuantLib

**Violation**: 10,744 analyzer warnings (primarily CA5392: P/Invoke security)

**Justification**:
- **Auto-Generated Code**: `NQuantLibcPINVOKE.cs` and related files are generated by SWIG from QuantLib C++ headers
- **Not Authored**: We do not write or control this code
- **Impractical to Fix**: Would require modifying SWIG toolchain or post-processing 32,000+ lines after every regeneration
- **Low Risk**: CA5392 (DefaultDllImportSearchPaths) is primarily a Windows DLL hijacking mitigation; Alaris runs on Linux
- **Controlled Deployment**: Native libraries (libNQuantLibc.so, libQuantLib.so) are deployed alongside assemblies

**Specific Suppressions in Alaris.Quantlib.csproj**:
```xml
<TreatWarningsAsErrors>false</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
<EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>false</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CS1591;CA5392;CA1062;CA2000</NoWarn>
```

**Suppressed Rules**:
- `CS1591`: Missing XML documentation (not generated by SWIG)
- `CA5392`: P/Invoke methods missing DefaultDllImportSearchPaths (10,744 violations)
- `CA1062`: Validate public arguments (SWIG doesn't generate guard clauses)
- `CA2000`: Dispose objects before losing scope (SWIG manages lifecycle)

**Decision**: **APPROVED** - Exclude entire project from strict enforcement

**Rationale**:
- High-integrity coding standard targets **authored code**
- Generated code should be isolated and managed separately
- Focus enforcement on Strategy, Double, and Test components where we have control
- Security risk is acceptable for Linux deployment

**Alternative Considered**:
1. Fork SWIG and modify code generator
   - **Rejected**: Maintenance burden, requires SWIG expertise
2. Post-process generated code with script
   - **Rejected**: Fragile, breaks on format changes
3. Roslyn source generator wrapper
   - **Rejected**: Too complex for marginal benefit

**Security Assessment**:
- ✅ **Acceptable Risk** for Linux deployment
- ⚠️ **Revisit** if deploying to Windows in future
- ✅ Native libraries deployed in controlled locations
- ✅ No user-supplied paths for library loading

**Review Date**: 2025-11-20
**Approved By**: Initial Assessment (Build Results)
**Next Review**: 2026-02-20 (3 months) or when deploying to Windows

## Exemption Guidelines

### When to Request Exemption:

1. **Technical Necessity**: Following the rule would compromise safety, correctness, or performance
2. **Third-Party Constraints**: External library requirements conflict with rules
3. **Generated Code**: Auto-generated code that cannot be modified
4. **Temporary**: Time-limited exemption during refactoring

### When NOT to Request Exemption:

1. **Convenience**: "It's easier to write this way"
2. **Lack of Understanding**: "I don't understand why this rule exists"
3. **Time Pressure**: "We don't have time to fix this now" (use technical debt instead)
4. **Disagreement**: "I don't think this rule is important" (discuss with team first)

---

## Review Process

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months):

1. Re-evaluate all active exemptions
2. Check if technical constraints have changed
3. Determine if refactoring is now feasible
4. Update or remove exemptions as needed

### Annual Review (Every 12 Months):

1. Full re-assessment of exemption policy
2. Review exemption patterns for systemic issues
3. Update exemption guidelines based on experience
4. Report exemption statistics to stakeholders
